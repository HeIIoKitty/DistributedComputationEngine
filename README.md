DistributedComputationEngine
============================

A system that can be used for networked distributed computing of any arbitrary .Net code. Requiring both a source file and class library, a .dll.

Note: In present time the project will be moving towards runtime compilation of code parsed from a .cs file. Explorations into dealing directly with only an assembly have turned up as a dead-end and may not be explored in the future sadly. Truly the goal was to deal and take as input only a .dll but due to the nature of the way that some things work in .Net this will not be possible.
